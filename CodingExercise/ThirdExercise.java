/*Java Conditionals: Evaluate Student Result with If-Else and Grading Logic

Student Performance Evaluation Using If-Else in Java

Write a Java program to evaluate a student's performance using if-else and else-if statements.

You are given the following:

    An integer variable score = 75

    A character variable grade = 'B'

Your task is to:

    Use if-else to check if the student passed or failed.

        A score of 50 or above is considered a pass.

        Print "Passed" or "Failed" accordingly.

    Use else-if conditions to assign and print a grade based on the score:

        A for 90 and above

        B for 75 to 89

        C for 60 to 74

        D for below 60

    Use System.out.println() to clearly display the output.

Instructions:

    The variables score and grade are already declared for you.

    Use if-else to evaluate pass/fail status.

    Use else-if to assign and print the grade based on the score.

    Ensure the output formatting matches the example output.

    Do not use ternary or switch statements in this exercise.


Expected Output:

  Passed

  Grade:  B*/
