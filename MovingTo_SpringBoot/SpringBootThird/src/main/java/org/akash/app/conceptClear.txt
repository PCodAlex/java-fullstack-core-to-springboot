🔵 Spring Boot 3-Layer Architecture (very short)

1️. Controller → UI layer (Entry point)

Handles HTTP request from user/browser

Calls service layer

Returns response (JSON/web page)

Example:
@RestController
Receives request → calls service → sends response

2️. Service → Business logic layer

Contains main logic/calculation

Processes data

Talks with repository

Example:
@Service
Calculate salary, validate login, process order etc.

3️. Repository → Database layer

Direct connection with database

Performs CRUD operations

Uses JPA/Hibernate

Example:
@Repository
Save, delete, update, fetch from DB

🔥 Simple Flow Diagram
	Client (Browser/Postman)
	        ↓
	Controller  → receives request
	        ↓
	Service     → business logic
	        ↓
	Repository  → database work
	        ↓
	Database
	💡 One-line interview answer

Controller → handles request
Service → contains business logic
Repository → interacts with database
