✅ 3. Thread Methods in Simple Language
3.1 thread.join()

Meaning:

“Wait for this thread to finish, then continue.”

Example:

t1.start();
t1.join();  // main waits for t1

3.2 Thread.sleep(ms)

Meaning:

“Pause this thread for some time.”

It does NOT release locks.

3.3 wait()

Meaning:

“Pause the thread until someone calls notify().
Release the lock.”

Must be used inside synchronized.

3.4 notify()

Meaning:

“Wake up ONE thread that is waiting.”

Must be used inside synchronized.

3.5 notifyAll()

Meaning:

“Wake up ALL waiting threads.”

3.6 thread.isAlive() (maybe you meant dead()?)

There is NO method called dead() in Java.

But you can check:

t.isAlive();

✅ 1. What is thread.isAlive()?

isAlive() is a method of the Thread class.

✔ Meaning:

Returns true if the thread has started and has not yet finished.

✔ When is it true?
Stage	isAlive()
Before start()	false
After start()	true
While running	true
After run() finishes	false
✔ Example:
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running...");
});

System.out.println(t.isAlive()); // false (not started)

t.start();

System.out.println(t.isAlive()); // true (running)

t.join();   // main waits

System.out.println(t.isAlive()); // false (completed)

🚨 2. Does sleep() take parameters?

Yes.

sleep takes milliseconds:
Thread.sleep(1000);   // sleep 1 second

✔ Optional version:
Thread.sleep(1000, 500);  // 1000 ms + 500 nanoseconds

✔ sleep() does NOT release the lock.
✔ sleep() does NOT need notify().
❓ 3. Do wait() and notify() take parameters?
✔ wait() — 3 versions
1️⃣ wait()

Waits indefinitely until notified.

obj.wait();

2️⃣ wait(long timeout)

Waits for a maximum time.

obj.wait(1000);  // wait 1 second (if no notify, wakes automatically)

3️⃣ wait(long timeout, int nanos)

High precision waiting.

obj.wait(1000, 500);

✔ notify() — no parameters
obj.notify();


Wakes ONE waiting thread.

✔ notifyAll() — no parameters
obj.notifyAll();


Wakes ALL waiting threads.

🔥 KEY DIFFERENCE SUMMARY
Method	Needs lock?	Releases lock?	Has Parameters?	Used For?
sleep()	❌ No	❌ No	✔ Yes (time)	Pause thread
wait()	✔ Yes	✔ Yes	✔ Yes	Thread communication
notify()	✔ Yes	❌ No	❌ No	Wake 1 waiter
notifyAll()	✔ Yes	❌ No	❌ No	Wake all waiters


thread
👉 If I use sleep(), do I need notify()?

NO.
sleep() will wake up automatically after the time ends.
No thread needs to notify it.

👉 Why do I need notify() when using wait()?

Because wait() means:

“I am stopping myself. Someone else must wake me up.”

Example:

wait();     // thread waits
notify();   // another thread wakes it


If no one calls notify(), the waiting thread will wait forever → deadlock.

✅ 4. What is synchronized? Why do we use it?
Meaning:

synchronized ensures that only one thread at a time can access a block of code.

Used to prevent race conditions (multiple threads modifying the same data at the same time).

🔥 Simple Explanation

Without synchronization:

Two people write on the same notebook → messy, incorrect.

With synchronization:

One person writes → finishes → next person writes.

⭐ When to use synchronized?

Use it when:

Multiple threads access shared data

Shared data must not be corrupted

You want thread safety

Example:

public synchronized void deposit(int amount) {
    balance += amount;
}


Only ONE thread can call deposit() at a time.


********************************************************************
🧵 1. NEW

Thread object is created but not started.

Thread t = new Thread();


State → NEW

🏃 2. RUNNABLE (Ready OR Running)

When you call:

t.start();


Thread becomes RUNNABLE.

Important:

RUNNABLE means:

Thread is ready to run OR

Thread is running on CPU

Java does not separate “ready” and “running” states.

🚧 3. BLOCKED

Thread enters BLOCKED state when:

It tries to enter a synchronized block/method

But another thread is still holding the lock

Example:

synchronized(obj) {  // thread 1 inside
    // thread 2 tries to enter → BLOCKED
}


State → BLOCKED until lock is free

⏳ 4. WAITING

Thread waits forever (until another thread signals it).

Thread enters WAITING when it calls:

wait()

join() (waiting for thread to finish)

park() (LockSupport)

Example:

obj.wait();   // waits until notify()


Requires synchronized block.

⏳ 5. TIMED_WAITING

Thread waits for a specific time.

Enters TIMED_WAITING when using:

sleep(1000)

wait(1000)

join(2000)

parkNanos(), parkUntil()

Example:

Thread.sleep(1000);  // 1 sec

🔚 6. TERMINATED

Thread finishes execution.

Thread reaches TERMINATED when:

run() method completes

OR an uncaught exception occurs

Check using:

t.isAlive();   // false when TERMINATED

🎯 VERY SHORT, INTERVIEW-READY DEFINITIONS
State	Meaning
NEW	Thread created but not started
RUNNABLE	Ready or running
BLOCKED	Waiting for lock
WAITING	Waiting forever until notify()
TIMED_WAITING	Waiting for specific time
TERMINATED	Finished execution

NEW → You created a worker

RUNNABLE → Worker is ready or working

BLOCKED → Worker waiting for a key to a locked room

WAITING → Worker waits until someone tells him to continue

TIMED_WAITING → Worker takes a timed nap

TERMINATED → Worker completed job and left
