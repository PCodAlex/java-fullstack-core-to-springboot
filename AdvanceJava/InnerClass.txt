✅ 1. Can a subclass extend a class AND implement an interface?

YES.

class Child extends Parent implements MyInterface {
}


Java allows:

Single inheritance (extend ONE class)

Multiple interface implementation (implement MANY interfaces)

✔ This is the most common pattern in Java.

✅ 2. Why anonymous inner class creates a new .class file but lambda does NOT?
Anonymous Inner Class

When you write:

Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    public void run() { }
};


Java creates a new class like:

OuterClass$1.class


Because anonymous inner class = real class created at compile time.

Lambda Expression

When you write:

Runnable r = () -> { };


Java does NOT create a new class file.

Instead, JVM uses:

invokedynamic


Which means the lambda is stored as a function, not a class.

✔ Faster
✔ No extra .class file
✔ Modern JVM feature

💡 So:

Anonymous class = new class file

Lambda = no class file (uses invokedynamic)
