✅ 1. Collection API (BIG umbrella)

Meaning:
➡️ The entire framework of interfaces + classes + algorithms used to store and process data.

Includes:

Interfaces (List, Set, Map, Queue…)

Classes (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap…)

Utility classes (Collections class)

Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)

Package: java.util.*

Short meaning:
✔ Collection API = Whole collection framework.

✅ 2. Collection (Interface)

Meaning:
➡️ The parent interface of List, Set, and Queue.

public interface Collection<E>


Everything except Map comes under this.

Short meaning:
✔ Collection = Top-level interface for groups of objects.

✅ 3. Collections (Utility Class)

Meaning:
➡️ A class of static methods like:

sort()

reverse()

shuffle()

min()

max()

Short meaning:
✔ Collections = Helper class with utility methods for collections.

Example:

Collections.sort(list);

💥 FINAL SHORT DIFFERENCE
Term	Type	Meaning
Collection API	Framework	Whole Java collection system
Collection	Interface	Parent of List, Set, Queue
Collections	Class	Utility class with static methods
📚 ALL COLLECTION TYPES IN JAVA (SHORT LIST)
🔹 1. List Interface (Ordered, duplicates allowed)
Class	Description
ArrayList	Fast, dynamic array
LinkedList	Doubly linked list
Vector	Synchronized array list
Stack	LIFO stack
🔹 2. Set Interface (No duplicates)
Class	Description
HashSet	Fast, no order
LinkedHashSet	Insertion order
TreeSet	Sorted set
🔹 3. Queue Interface
Class	Description
PriorityQueue	Min-heap, priority order
ArrayDeque	Fast double-ended queue
🔹 4. Map Interface (Key–Value pairs)

(Not part of Collection interface, but part of Collection API)

Class	Description
HashMap	Fast, no order
LinkedHashMap	Insertion order
TreeMap	Sorted map
Hashtable	Synchronized
Properties	Key-value strings
⭐ Super-Short Summary (One-liners)

Collection API → Whole Java data structure framework.

Collection → Parent interface of List, Set, Queue.

Collections → Utility class with helpers like sort(), reverse().
